# ASEP-Project

The website for the Autonomous Street Dog Feeder with Health Monitoring is designed to track and display feeding schedules and health data for street dogs. It allows users to add dog profiles, view feeding records, and monitor temperature readings. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL for backend support, the website receives data from an Arduino-based system via an ESP32 module, ensuring smooth communication between the hardware and software.
